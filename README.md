# 🛑 Project Status
The project is ongoing and actually in use so I will keep managing it until I found no more use for it.

# 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to track and notify me about specific actions realized by an ensemble of crypto wallet that I watch. The specific actions are adding liquidity or withdrawing liquidity from a Meteora DAMM Pool because I think there is certainly a little bit of edge concerning that these product is really recent and observing profitable wallet can maybe lead to profitability.

Next step is adding maybe some automation around copy trading but I need first to figure out how to use Meteora DLMM API and Solana API.

# ⚙️ Technologies Used
To monitor and analyze wallet activity, the project relied on the following services:

- Cloudflare Workers – to handle incoming webhook requests

- Helius – for blockchain webhooks and RPC access

- Telegram API – for sending real-time alerts
