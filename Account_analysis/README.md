# Folder: Analyse_Account

## ðŸ“„ Purpose
This folder contains code related to the collection and analysis of pools and wallets in order to identify profitable wallets based on their transactions through Meteora DAMM v2 â€” with the potential goal of copying their transactions.

## ðŸ”„ Next Improvements

- **Enhance `Check_trans_pool.ts`**  
  Update the `Check_trans_pool.ts` file to calculate and display profitability, using a similar method as implemented in `Check_trans_wallet.ts`.

- **Add Wallet Activity Visualization**  
  Create a new module or script dedicated to visualizing wallet activity. This should include charts or summaries of transaction patterns, volume, and any other insightful metrics.

- **Implement Date-Based Filtering**  
  Introduce an option to filter wallet transactions or signatures based on a specified date range. This will allow for more targeted analysis over specific time periods.

## ðŸ“¦ Contents
- `Get_transac.ts` â€“ Retrieves a list of transactions for a specific address (pool or wallet).
- `Check_trans_pool.ts` â€“ Analyzes the different addresses adding/removing liquidity in a pool and evaluates the profitability of their movements.
- `Check_trans_wallet.ts` â€“ Analyzes liquidity interactions for a specific wallet and evaluates their profitability across pools.

## ðŸ§ª How to Use
First, run `Get_transac.ts` with a specific address and a specific number of max transactions â€” this can be a DAMM v2 liquidity pool or a wallet address.

Depending on what you want to analyze:
- **Liquidity Pool:** Run `Check_trans_pool.ts`
- **Wallet:** Run `Check_trans_wallet.ts`
